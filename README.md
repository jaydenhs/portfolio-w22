# Jayden's Winter 2022 Portfolio

Still a work in progress!
I'm redesiging my portfolio to achieve three things:

1. Better developer experience
2. Differentiate myself creatively
3. Engaging consumer experience

Created with Gatsby, GraphQL querying from MDX, Tailwind CSS + styled-components (with babel twin.macro plugin), Framer Motion, and Three.js.
