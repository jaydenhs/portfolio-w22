# Context

In the summer of 2021, I was an intern at construction tech startup
StructionSite. This case study focuses on my redesign of the project onboarding
experience within SmartTrack, a product which automatically tracks construction
work.

This is what the experience looked like:

<FullBleed>
  <GatsbyImage alt='Sam in a destroyed mall' image={getImage(props.localImages.find((n) => n.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData.images.fallback.src.includes("zoom-and-slack")))} />
</FullBleed>

<GatsbyImage alt='Sam in a destroyed mall' image={getImage(props.localImages.find((n) => n.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData.images.fallback.src.includes("data-mapping")))} />

The SmartTrack project setup took the bulk of the time, often taking two weeks
or more. The process was composed of two steps:

1. Draw vectors in SmartTrack that match the customer's existing files
2. Assign those vectors properties based on the customer's requirements

    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-3/4"
    caption="What the current project setup process looked like"
  />
</FullBleed>

# The Problem

<HighlightedSection>

With customer files containing thousands of vectors, this painfully manual
process was wasting **hundreds of our internal team's valuable hours**. This
delay resulted in trial customers failing to see the value of SmartTrack,
leading to **high average customer acquisition cost and lost sales
opportunities**.

</HighlightedSection>

# Understanding the Problem

I began by interviewing five users to better understand their pain points. I
also set up a project myself to better empathize with the frustrations
expressed.

<Note left={false}>

  <Accordion title={"How did I select these users?"}>

I utilized SmartTrack's data analytics to select users with varying experiences
with the setup process.

I ended up speaking with a customer success manager, superintendent, QC
engineer, PM intern, and the head of product.

  </Accordion>

</Note>

I uncovered several pain points. In this case study, I'll be focusing on one:
**the duplication of human effort**. The setup process collected customer files,
but our team was responsible for manually duplicating all of the data into
SmartTrack. We were wasting hundreds of hours tediously drawing lines over
existing lines.

# Defining Success

From those conversations, I centered the success of this project around these
three goals:

<NumberedList
  data={[
    {
      title: "Maximize efficiency",
      description:
        "The most critical goal was to reduce the time required to setup each customer project. The shorter the process, the lower our customer acquisition cost becomes.",
    },
    {
      title: "Improve intuitiveness",
      description:
        "Aligning the mental model of SmartTrack's features, modes, and tooling with construction industry standards would improve setup accuracy.",
    },
    {
      title: "Reduce frustration",
      description:
        "Users are able to easily amend mistakes and accomplish their tasks without interruption.",
    },
  ]}
/>

# The Epiphany

My belief that there had to be a better way to set up projects was confirmed
when one of the users stated this:

> "The ideal state of SmartTrack is being able to **import customers' existing
> data**. Importing customers' files would be nice to have as a baseline, and
> then it's just verification afterwards."

# Technical Exploration

Before sketching out any designs, I first needed to validate if such an import
feature was possible. I created a simple file in one of the most popular
construction tracking programs and opened the exported PDF in Notepad.

To my delight, it had **all of the information I needed**:

<FullBleed>
  <Image
    src={"data-mapping.jpg"}
    caption="Vertices and properties were available as plain text in Bluebeam Revu's exports"
    className="w-3/4 mx-auto"
  />
</FullBleed>

# Pivoting for Impact

Prior to detailing this option further, I wanted to ensure that we were building
the most impactful file import option. After discussing with our customer
success manager, I discovered that over 90% of our current SmartTrack customers
submitted files from a different program.

To **maximize the value** gained from a first iteration of this feature, I
decided to pivot to importing from this more popular program instead.

<Image src={"pivoting-to-ost.png"} className="mb-2 w-3/4 mx-auto" />

Through a similar process as before, I validated that necessary information was
available within this program's exports.

# Defining a User Flow

I created a user flow to better define the scope of the solution I was building.
This also gave me the perfect opportunity to receive early feedback from
stakeholders and validate feasibility with developers.

<FullBleed>
  <Image src={"import-user-flow-1.png"} className="mt-2 w-3/5 mx-auto" />
</FullBleed>

# Presenting the Concept

To communicate this user flow, I created a simple set of designs:

<FullBleed>
  <Image src={"import-initial-mockups.png"} className="w-4/5 mx-auto" />
</FullBleed>

After incorporating feedback from our weekly product and design team meeting,
the project was **green-lit for production** and I was provided with one
engineer to pair with for a week.

# Refining for Production

I prepared a specifications doc of the user interfaces and parsing algorithms
necessary for hand-off in Notion. After discussing with my engineer, I realized
I was missing two key pieces: we could only import one page from the On-Screen
Takeoff file, and there were non-trivial loading times.

Thus, I needed to revise my user flow to:

<FullBleed>
  <Image src={"import-user-flow-2.png"} className="w-4/5 mx-auto mt-2" />
</FullBleed>

# Adapting the UI

These revisions resulted in the introduction of an intermediary user flow. Use
the arrows in the prototype below to navigate through my design decisions:

    }
    hideUI={true}
  />
</FullBleed>

# The Big Reveal

After the feature was released to production under a feature flag, I demoed it
live to the solutions engineer and customer success manager who inspired the
concept. They were very, very excited.

</FullBleed>

> This is probably the single **most functionally developed feature** that I've
> seen in my time here that will fundamentally change how we do SmartTrack. This
> is pretty freakin' cool. Just drop out of school and stay here man!

Their reaction was so positive that I later presented at StructionSite's
All-Hands meeting, to even louder acclamation.

# Success!

The import feature exceeded my original goals. It reduced setup time from days
to mere seconds. By aligning with existing industry standards, it enabled
perfect accuracy. It did not simply reduce frustration, but now users were
excited to set up projects.
