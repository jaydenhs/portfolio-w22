# Redesigning the Renewals

Every five years, Ontarians must renew their driver’s licence and health card to maintain their benefits.

Ontario’s online renewal platforms were meant to provide an efficient alternative to the in-person process. Instead, the service’s incoherence and exclusion of those who do not have a driver's licence left thousands of users frustrated and confused.<br/>

I was part of an ambitious project to redesign Ontario’s renewal experience for its over 5 million annual users.­­­

# Project Info

As a product designer, I worked in a small but effective team of five: our lab leader Xiaopu Fung, lead designer Sukhi Chuhan, fellow product designer Emily Louie, and prototype developers Muiz Sohani and Niya Xu.

Within the Kitchener-Waterloo lab of the Ontario Digital Service, we conducted most of our projects in a series of 4-6 adapted Google sprints.

Mondays were focused on user research, Tuesdays and Wednesdays on prototyping, Thursdays on user testing, and Fridays on presenting our findings. To ensure thorough and clear communication, every day began with a stand-up and ended with a check-in.

| Role              | Team                           | Tools           | Duration           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Product thinking  | 1 lab leader                   | Figma, Balsamiq | Sept. to Oct. 2019 |
| Prototyping       | 1 lead designer                | Miro, React     | (5 weekly sprints)
| User research     | 2 developers                   |                 |
| Developer handoff | 2 product designers (incl. me) |                 |

# Defining Key Pain Points

During our team's initial meetings with the current stakeholders of the renewal platforms, we were informed that on each of the platforms, there was a Rate Our Service form that users could fill and submit.

Seeing that analyzing this direct and honest feedback would be one of the best ways for our team could begin to empathize with the frustrations of these users, our team seized this opportunity and efficiently categorized over **1,593 submissions** based on topic and frequency.

Our team then identified the most prominent complaints and focused our future redesign efforts on amending these pain points.

| Gather data | Analyze feedback           | Identify pain points |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
|             | 1,593 feedback submissions | 3 pain points        |

# Turning Suffering Into Solutions

From our discussions with subject matter experts and analysis of raw user feedback, our team diagnosed three major issues with the current service:

          "If you did not click the correct link at first, it was **very difficult** to find the option to renew just your driver's licence and not your health card.",
