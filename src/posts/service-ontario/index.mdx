Every five years, Ontarians must renew their driver’s licence and health card to
maintain their benefits.

Ontario’s online renewal platforms were meant to provide an efficient
alternative to the in-person process. Instead, the service’s incoherence and
exclusion of those who do not have a driver's licence left thousands of users
frustrated and confused.<br/>

I was part of an ambitious project to redesign Ontario’s renewal experience for
its over 5 million annual users.­­­

# Project Info

<Note left={true}>

  <Accordion title={"What did our weekly sprints entail?"}>

Mondays were focused on user research, Tuesdays and Wednesdays on prototyping,
Thursdays on user testing, and Fridays on presenting our findings.

To ensure thorough and clear communication, every day began with a stand-up and
ended with a check-in.

# Defining Key Pain Points

During our team's initial meetings with the current stakeholders of the renewal
platforms, we were informed that on each of the platforms, there was a Rate Our
Service form that users could fill and submit.

Seeing that analyzing this direct and honest feedback would be one of the best
ways for our team could begin to empathize with the frustrations of these users,
our team seized this opportunity and efficiently categorized over **1,593
submissions** based on topic and frequency.

Our team then identified the most prominent complaints and focused our future
redesign efforts on amending these pain points.

| Gather data | Analyze feedback           | Identify pain points |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
|             | 1,593 feedback submissions | 3 pain points        |

# Turning Suffering Into Solutions

From our discussions with subject matter experts and analysis of raw user
feedback, our team diagnosed three major issues with the current service:

<FullBleed>
  <PainPoints
    data={[
      {
        image: 'pain-difficult.png',
        title: 'Difficult to find the appropriate service',
        quotes: [
          "The system only works if you are renewing both [of your cards] at the same time. This means I have to go to a ServiceOntario centre for my health card just because I do not drive. **I'm very disappointed.**",
          "If you did not click the correct link at first, it was **very difficult** to find the option to renew just your driver's licence and not your health card.",
        ],
        result:
          'Combine the standalone and integrated services into a universal renewal service',
      },
      {
        image: 'pain-vague.png',
        title: 'Can’t understand why they cannot complete the process',
        quotes: [
          "After I entered my driver's licence information, I was told I was ineligible **without indication of the reason.** If I am considered ineligible to renew online, please **tell me why.**",
          "My renewal was denied and I was **not given any reason** besides 'you're not eligible'. I think the government owes **more explanation** when it denies a service to a citizen.",
        ],
        result:
          'Explain the reason of all errors and clearly outline next steps',
      },

        title: 'Redundant and convoluted text and questions',
        quotes: [
          'Had to enter **my name thrice and address at twice** after I had already selected that there have been no changes. **Very annoying!**',
          "**It wasn't clear** on the site when I need to get a new photo in-person. A line of added text on this topic in the instructions would be useful.",
        ],
        result:
          'Reduce the repetitive input of information and simplify language',
      },

# Understanding the User and Project

premortem, stakeholder analysis, and jurisdictional analysis here.

# Defining the Challenge

Considering how one of our product owner's primary concerns when approaching
this project was that our redesign's scope would be too large, our team
approached our problem definition with a divergent and convergent thinking
process.

## How Might We's

From our initial research, my fellow product designer and I ideated a diverse
set of solutions to users' current problems.

<FullBleed>
  <MiroEmbed
    title={
      "Miro board showing our ideation of a diverse set of solutions to users' current problems."
    }
    board_src={'https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kuecCiE=/'}
  />
</FullBleed>

Whether it was further improving the effectiveness of help modals, reassuring
the user of the information they input, or optimizing the Ontario.ca topic
page's representation of renewal services, this divergence in our brainstorming
then allowed us to converge upon a single problem statement:

<HighlightedSection title={"Problem Statement"}>

We have observed that the ServiceOntario online renewal flows are **not meeting
user needs**, which is causing low completion rates, negative user feedback,
inclusion concerns, and low uptake on digital services.

How might we design a **one-window digital renewal transaction flow** that
promotes usability and inclusion by reducing time on task and increasing
positive feedback on eligibility?

</HighlightedSection>

# Starting With the Best Case Scenario

Especially with a renewal service, there is certainly no lack in the number of
paths, exceptions, and errors that a user can take to encounter along their
journey.

Thus, we first highlighted the requirements that a user would need to meet to
successfully renew their driver's licence or health card.

<TrelloEmbed
  title={
    "Trello board showing the requirements that a user would need to meet to successfully renew their driver's licence or health card."
  }
  src={'https://trello.com/b/hJOm6Iwx'}
/>

Then, to emphasize an easy and effortless central flow in our redesign, we
identified the key set of steps that a user would take to successfully renew
their driver's licence or health card.

<FullBleed>
  <Timeline
    markers={[
      'User visits platform',
      'Selects type of identity card to renew',
      'Enters identity card information',
      'Answers eligibilty questions',
      'Pays for renewal',
      'Receives their renewed identity card!',
    ]}
  />

# Clarity, Clarity, Clarity

Equipped with a low-fidelity prototype of our redesigned renewal platform's
ideal user journey, my fellow designers and I traveled to the heart of downtown
Toronto to conduct guerilla user testing.

<Note left={true}>

  <Accordion title={"Did we target any specific user segments?"}>

Yes, we aimed to talk to demographics who were less familiar with technology,
such as seniors.

If our solution made sense to them, then hopefully it would make sense to
everyone else!

<ImageGrid images={['portrait-1.jpg', 'user-testing-1.jpg']} />

Our team then synthesized our findings into prototype iterations to consider in

# Designing Alternate Paths

For our second iteration, our team considered a more realistic approach for our
redesign - it was time to integrate in error states and eligibility
complexities. Thus, we once again collaborated with stakeholders to ensure that
our solution would be able to encompass all of the necessary technical
requirements of the previous platform.

# Extending a Helping Hand

It was time for our second round of guerilla user testing sessions! This time,
having gained more confidence and practice for the user research methodology, my
fellow product designer and I went by ourselves.

| Team                  | Interviews                 | Prototype                  |

Equipped with a much more comprehensive prototype, we were able to gather a
richer understanding of the end users' reactions to our newly designed
ineligibility errors and transaction summary page.

# Content is Key

With ten facilitations of guerilla usability testing sessions under my belt, it
was time to help a developer teammate learn these key user research principles
during our third round of user testing!

Once again, one of our dominant issues was a lack of clarity in the content used
in our design. Now with a month of experience in the problem space, our team
likely had become so familiar with government terminology that we had not
considered how confusing its use would be to our user base.

We noted these findings, and after presenting them at our weekly show and tell,
we were able to work with our content designer to implement their feedback.

# Implementing Inclusivity

In our discussions at the beginning of this engagement, one of the most urgent
requests brought up by stakeholders was for us to integrate the renewal of the
Ontario Photo Card into the platform.

<MediaWithPoints media={"opc.png"} imageClassName={"rotate-6"}>

- Ontario photo cards help provide valid identification for **over 1.5 million**
  Ontarians who do not drive.

- There is **no online platform** for renewal of an Ontario photo card or
  renewal of a health card using an Ontario photo card.

- This is an **accessibility issue** for those who are unable to access renewal
  centres or who need to renew their health card.

Once again, our team collaborated with stakeholders to define the ideal user
journey and document the complexities of the in-person renewal service to
effectively translate this process into a efficient online process.

# Polishing the Prototype

Though only my fellow product designer and a developer conducted this final set
of guerilla user tests, I was nevertheless was instrumental in integrating the
gathered feedback into our prototype.

For this iteration, our team learned the importance of taking the vertical
restriction of a mobile user interface into account in
[our coded prototype](https://sorenewals.firebaseapp.com/).

# Results and Recommendations

Though we were unable to present our final prototype to the executives of the
Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Health that we were partnering with,
we still were able to summarize our reasoning and display our prototype to our
product owners.

After our presentation, one of the product owners stated:

> Jayden understands complex nuances quickly and thinks in a user-centric way.
> He is excellent at trying something, getting valuable input from real users,
> iterating, and documenting findings. Beyond great results, it's a pleasure to
> work and collaborate with him. He's a quick study and also a collaborative
> partner with subject matter experts.

# Learning and Growing, One Project at a Time

Working in the Ontario Digital Service Kitchener-Waterloo Lab was an
unforgettable experience. Not only did projects such as this allow me to
exponentially grow my skillset through exposure to unique, enterprise-level
opportunities, but this small but mighty team of six taught me how to enjoy
every second of it!

<Image src={'the-team.jpg'} className="my-2" />

Despite this growth, I still recognize that my designs and process are far from
perfect. In the spirit of our team's weekly retrospectives, here are my three
areas of future improvement:

      description:
        "No matter how confident I felt in my assumptions about the problem space, that's all they were - assumptions. This project reinforced my belief in the importance of user feedback to ensure that our prototype met real-world expectations and needs.",
    },

      title: 'Be comfortable with being uncomfortable',
      description:
        'Despite my extroversion, I remember how uncomfortable I was during our first guerilla user testing session. However, once I approached that first stranger and successfully conducted an interview, I recognized the situation as an opportunity to learn. While it will be frightening, I hope to approach future situations with a similar eagerness to explore.',

      title: 'Challenge my capabilities',
      description:
        'When our team was told that we had a week to create a prototype with Balsamiq, an application that I had never used before, I knew that I was up for a challenge. After experiencing rapid growth in my skillset as a result of this short time frame, I have recognized that learning thrives in difficulty.',
