As a UX/UI design intern at TD's Innovation Lab, I was tasked with rapidly
prototyping experiences that could impact millions of users.

Within my first week, I quickly realized that there was no complete source or
conceptual documentation for styles, UI elements, or design patterns. In such an
agile environment, this led to **severe inefficiencies** in our design
workflows.

So, I embarked on a self-driven project to create the foundation for TD Lab's
design system.

# The Current State

## Observation

My first order of business was to understand how the lab currently designed.
After a few conversations, it was evident that while the lab did have an minimal
Sketch pattern library, its unfinished nature resulted in a lot of time being
spent on creating user interface elements from scratch.

<!-- A designs with symbols from Sketch pattern library -> A updates Sketch pattern
library -> A sends design file to B and updated pattern library file to the team
-> B changes file -> B uploads file to Zeplin -> B sends Zeplin link to
developers -> B sends design file back to A

Sketch's lack of any online synchronization combined with the inherent struggles
of remote communication led to agonizing difficulty in collaboration, with
design interns often spending days asking people for the latest files (@me). -->

## Inventory

My next task was to inventory the common UI elements used in the lab's previous
projects. I collected Sketch project files, analyzed the current pattern
library, read over the minimal Atlassian documentation we had, and took
screenshots of previous projects.

## Audit

Once I felt I had captured every button, icon, and design pattern I grouped them
into categories. Viewing them side-by-side revealed exactly why we needed a
system. Without any documentation, many of our prototypes lacked in
accessibility, with elements being used incorrectly and colours not satisfying
contrast ratios.

<HighlightedSection title={"Problem Statement"}>

We have observed that the TD Lab design library is not meeting user needs, which
is causing **inefficient** design workflows and poor accessibility in
prototypes.

How might we build a **design library** that promotes inclusion and innovation
by improving accessibility documentation and reducing time spent on creating and
updating interface elements?

# Identifying Best Practices

To ensure that the design library was future-proof, I started this project with
some heavy research into design library and UI design best practices.

I studied Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Google's Material Design
Guidelines, analyzed design systems from Atlassian, Uber, Github, and Figma, and
read through countless Medium articles.

# The Structure

Inspired by Dropbox's design system, I decided to structure the design library
in a two-tiered hierarchy:

By creating separate UI Kits that inherit from Global Styles, we get the best of
both worlds - the consistency of having shared styles with the flexibility of
being able to toggle on specific UI kits based on the project scope.

Let's take a look at what each of those files contained:

# Global Styles

This file was responsible for

# Components

# Learnings
